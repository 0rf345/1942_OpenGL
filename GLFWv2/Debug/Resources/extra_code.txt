// TODO: implement joystick input, seems easy, should be cool

1st stage 1:30min

basic 1h 

we SCROLL to the end, we DO NOT FLY to the end of the level
at which point we land (no controls) and enemies .die()

kamikazes (guys which rush to you and back off)
do so towards you, they do not touch you

6-7-digit scores in an array and drawn as arrays for ease of use (pre-buffer the textures and bind accordingly)

our firing is actually more advanced than the game's cause each bullet is an instance so it can die alone.

collision detection: TR-TL inside other?

GET THE REFRESH STUFF AND DRAWING CLOSER TOGETHER SO THE OPENGL LOOP DOESNT SLOW DOWN!!!
